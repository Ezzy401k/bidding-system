# Secret Auction Program

This Python program implements a secret auction where bidders can place bids anonymously for a specific item.

## How it Works

The program prompts the user to enter the item they are bidding on. Then, it continuously asks for bidders' names and their bids until there are no more bidders. Once all bids are entered, the program determines the winner(s) based on the highest bid.

If there is only one bidder with the highest bid, they are declared the winner. If there are multiple bidders with the same highest bid, it results in a draw.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ezzy401k/bidding=system.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd bidding-system
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python bidding-system.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to enter the item, bidder names, and bids.

5. After the auction ends, the program will display the winner(s) or inform about a draw.

## Example

```python
python bidding-system.py
```

```
